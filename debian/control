Description: Proposed OpenStack identity service - Python library
 Keystone is a proposed independent authentication service for OpenStack.
 .
 This initial proof of concept aims to address the current use cases in Swift
 and Nova which are:
 .
  * REST-based, token auth for Swift
  * many-to-many relationship between identity and tenant for Nova. Keystone
    does authentication and stuff
 .
 This package contains the Python libraries.
